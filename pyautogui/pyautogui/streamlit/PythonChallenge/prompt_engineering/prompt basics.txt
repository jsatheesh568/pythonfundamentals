### **Scenario 2: Creative Content Creation**

#### ‚ùå Poor Prompt:
```
Write a blog post about AI
```

#### ‚úÖ Excellent Prompt:
```
**ROLE:** You are a tech journalist and thought leader who writes for TechCrunch, with expertise in making complex AI concepts accessible to business leaders.

**TASK:** Write an engaging blog post about how small businesses can leverage AI tools in 2024, targeting non-technical business owners who are curious but cautious about AI adoption.

**CONTEXT:**
- Target audience: Small business owners (10-50 employees)
- Pain points: Limited budget, fear of complexity, lack of technical expertise
- Current AI landscape: ChatGPT, automation tools, customer service bots becoming mainstream
- Goal: Encourage adoption while addressing concerns
- Competitor content: Often too technical or too generic

**FEW-SHOTS:**
Hook example: "Sarah's bakery was drowning in customer emails until she discovered a $20/month AI tool that now handles 80% of her inquiries..."

Section example:
"**Customer Service Revolution**
Instead of hiring a full-time support person at $40K/year, small businesses are using AI chatbots that:
‚Ä¢ Handle 24/7 customer inquiries
‚Ä¢ Reduce response time from hours to seconds  
‚Ä¢ Cost less than $100/month
Real example: [specific case study]"

**REPORTS/TONE:**

- SEO: Target "AI tools for small business" keyword family

**TREE OF THOUGHTS:**
Explore different angles:
Path A: Focus on cost savings and ROI
Path B: Emphasize ease of use and quick wins  
Path C: Address fears and misconceptions first
‚Üí Best approach: Combine B and C - start with addressing fears, then show easy wins
```

### **Scenario 3: Technical Problem Solving**

#### ‚ùå Poor Prompt:
```
Fix my code
```

#### ‚úÖ Excellent Prompt:
```
**ROLE:** You are a senior Python developer and debugging expert with deep knowledge of web scraping, data processing, and performance optimization.

**TASK:** Debug and optimize this Python web scraping script that's running too slowly and occasionally crashes when processing large datasets.

**CONTEXT:**
- Script scrapes product data from e-commerce sites
- Processing ~10,000 URLs daily
- Current issues: 
  * Takes 6+ hours (should be <2 hours)
  * Memory errors with large datasets
  * Occasional HTTP timeout failures
- Environment: Python 3.9, requests library, BeautifulSoup, running on Ubuntu server
- Constraints: Must respect robots.txt, can't exceed 1 req/second per domain

**CODE:**
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import time

def scrape_product(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    # ... processing logic
    return product_data

urls = get_urls()  # Returns list of 10,000 URLs
results = []
for url in urls:
    data = scrape_product(url)
    results.append(data)
    time.sleep(1)
```

**FEW-SHOTS:**
Optimization example:
"**Issue:** Synchronous processing creates bottleneck
**Solution:** Implement async processing with controlled concurrency
**Code:**
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def scrape_product_async(session, url):
    # async implementation
    pass
```

**REPORTS/TONE:**
- Format: 
  1. **Issue Analysis** (identify bottlenecks)
  2. **Optimized Code** (with comments explaining changes)
  3. **Performance Improvements** (expected speed gains)
  4. **Error Handling** (robust exception management)
- Tone: Technical but explanatory
- Include: Before/after performance estimates

**REACT REASONING:**
**Thought:** The script has multiple performance issues - synchronous processing, no connection pooling, potential memory leaks
**Action:** I'll analyze each bottleneck and provide optimized solutions
**Observation:** Main issues are I/O blocking, memory accumulation, and lack of error handling
**Reflection:** Need to implement async processing, batch processing, and proper resource management
```

### **Scenario 4: Educational Content**

#### ‚ùå Poor Prompt:
```
Explain machine learning
```

#### ‚úÖ Excellent Prompt:
```

**FEW-SHOTS:**
Analogy example:
"Think of supervised learning like teaching a child to recognize animals:
1. **Training:** You show them 1000 photos labeled 'cat' or 'dog'
2. **Learning:** They notice patterns (cats have pointy ears, dogs come in more sizes)
3. **Testing:** You show unlabeled photos and they guess correctly 85% of the time"

Code example structure:
```python
# Step 1: Load and explore data
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('housing_prices.csv')
print(f"Dataset shape: {data.shape}")  # Always show what we're working with

# Step 2: Prepare features
# [Clear explanation of each step]
```

**REPORTS/TONE:**
- Format: 
  * **Part 1:** Concepts with analogies (20 min)
  * **Part 2:** Hands-on coding walkthrough (50 min)  
  * **Part 3:** Common pitfalls and next steps (20 min)
- Tone: Encouraging, patient, building confidence
- Style: Interactive with frequent check-ins
- Visuals: Include 3-4 simple diagrams/flowcharts

**CHAIN OF THOUGHT:**
Structure learning progression:
1. First, establish intuitive understanding with analogies
2. Then, introduce mathematical concepts gradually
3. Next, demonstrate with hands-on coding
4. Finally, discuss real-world applications and limitations

**Success Criteria:**
By end of lesson, students should be able to:
- Explain ML to a non-technical friend
- Implement a basic linear regression
- Interpret model accuracy metrics
- Identify when NOT to use ML

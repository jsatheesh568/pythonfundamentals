- ✅ **List** → Store multiple students  
- ✅ **Tuple** → Fixed seat position `(row, column)`  
- ✅ **Set** → Ensure unique student IDs  
- ✅ **Dictionary** → Store student attributes (`name`, `age`, `marks`)  
- ✅ **Control Flow** → If/Else, Nested If for grade calculation  
- ✅ **Loops** → `for` & `while` loops  
- ✅ **Functions** → `calculate_grade()`, `save_to_file()`  
- ✅ **Error Handling** → `try/except` for invalid input  
- ✅ **File Handling** → Save report cards into `report_cards.txt`
